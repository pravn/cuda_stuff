Experiments in CUDA.
Sources: Wen-Mei Hwu's book, Shane Cook's book and parallelforall blog.

1) matmul_naive: Trivial matrix multiplication with no attempt at parallelization.
2) matmul_shem: Tiling and shared memory (incomplete).
3) ballot - attempt at using ballot+popc to replace atomics. Single block.
	- ballot_atomicadd1 uses an atomicOr to collect ballot return.
	- balloc_atomicadd2 stores results of ballot in register and reduces 
4) shffl - shffl instructions to do reductions.
