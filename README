1) matmul_naive: Trivial matrix multiplication with no attempt at parallelization.
2) matmul_shem: Tiling and shared memory (incomplete).
3) ballot - attempt at using ballot+popc to replace atomics. Single block.
	- ballot_atomicadd1 uses an atomicOr to collect ballot return.
	- ballot_atomicadd2 stores results of ballot in register and reduces 
4) shffl - shffl instructions to do reductions. 

5) histogram - using ballot and atomics to compute histogram. ballot
	implementation simply adds an extra array dimension to 3) for each
	bin. Check later to compare speed with that of atomicAdd.

TODO
	Multiblock kernels for ballot, shuffl, histogram and atomics.
